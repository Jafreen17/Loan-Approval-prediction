# Loan-Approval-prediction

Loan Approval Prediction Project

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the dataset by handling missing values and transforming skewed data using log transformations for variables such as loan amount and total income.
Feature Engineering: Created new features to enhance model performance, including combining applicant and coapplicant income and creating logarithmic transformations of key features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted thorough EDA to identify patterns, correlations, and insights, utilizing visualizations created with Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Model Implementation: Applied machine learning algorithms, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), to predict loan approval outcomes.
Model Evaluation: Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure the model's effectiveness in predicting loan approvals.
Documentation: Documented the entire process in a Jupyter Notebook, including code, methodology, and insights from the analysis and modeling phases.
